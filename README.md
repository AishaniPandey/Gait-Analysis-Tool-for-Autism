# **Autism Gait Analysis Tool**

## **Overview**
This project is an AI-driven **gait and behavior-based autism screening platform** developed in collaboration with **Choice Foundation**. The tool enables **early detection and intervention** for autism by analyzing movement patterns, head positioning, and speech characteristics, providing a scalable and automated screening solution.

## **Key Features**
- ✅ **Automated Gait & Behavior Analysis** – Detects movement irregularities associated with autism.  
- ✅ **Speech & Head Positioning Tracking** – Assesses additional behavioral markers.  
- ✅ **Consistent Patient Record Management** – Ensures accurate and accessible health records.  
- ✅ **Scalable Screening Methodology** – Supports large-scale implementation in schools and healthcare settings.  

## **Technology Stack**
- **MongoDB** – Database for patient records and analysis reports  
- **Express.js** – Backend API for processing and analysis  
- **React.js** – User interface for screening and results visualization  
- **Node.js** – Server-side logic and API handling  

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection** – Captures movement, speech, and head positioning.  
2. **Preprocessing & Analysis** – Uses ML models for feature extraction and pattern detection.  
3. **Screening & Report Generation** – Provides risk assessment and reports for doctors and NGOs.  

## **Impact & Collaboration**
This tool has been deployed in partnership with **Choice Foundation**, which has already screened over **9,000 students** through their **My Child Health** program and provided early intervention support to **300+ children**.
